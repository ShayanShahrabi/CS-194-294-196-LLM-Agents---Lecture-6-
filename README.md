# CS 194/294-196 (LLM Agents) - Lecture 6 

Delve into the intricate interplay of software engineering and AI! Explore the influence of software across diverse domains such as agriculture and autonomous vehicles.


Key challenges in crafting coding agents encompass defining environments (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), designing observations/actions, and navigating complexities like code generation and file localization. Noteworthy concepts include CodeAct, which engages with environments through programmatic interactions, and the nuanced considerations of planning, error recovery, and safety.


Strategies such as sandboxing, credentialing, and post-hoc auditing are pivotal in mitigating risks associated with coding models. While current tools like Copilots are proving instrumental, challenges persist in areas like code LLMS, editing, and safety protocols. Future trajectories may involve advanced agent training methodologies and the expansion of software tasks beyond coding paradigms.
